No Longer by Cauldron

Losing and everything's
Been taken
Treading but gradually
You're failing
Feeling so weak
How will you make it
Faking your peace
Inside you're shaken

No longer feel like facing
The day that has been taken
The dream's no longer waiting
The seams are torn and fraying

Continued strain
Of constant trailing
Concealing everything
You're facing
Abhorrence drives
Your inner sorrow
Listening carefully
Not to follow

You hold me closely
But I've been redeemed
Just a victim of
What's been conceived
Alone and cold
There's no way to win
Sinking deeply
Immersed in your sin
